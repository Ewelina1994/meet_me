# meet_me
A simple application that, after providing a list of booked, daily meetings, calculates among these people the free dates for a meeting of all added people. 
The cutTheMeetWhenExceedsGeneralWorkingDay method receives a list of objects that store booked appointments during one day and returns the request of hours to arrange all these people.
